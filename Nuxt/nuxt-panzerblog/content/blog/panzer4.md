<h1 class="text-xl font-bold">The Blueprint</h1>
The Panzer IV was meant to support the Panzer III and infantry at first as the Panzer III it would serve as Germanys main force in tank-to-tank warfare. However the ease of fitting larger weapons and improving both suspension and engine made it quickly take over the role as the German lead tank to combat the larger number of T34 from Soviet leading to the two models switching roles. It was later replaced by the much more popular and capable Tiger 1. Due to this difference between the support variety and the main battletank and all different kinds of guns it has a lot of models. Out of the 10 different models the most common was the Panzer IV G, IV H and Panzer IV Ausf. D. The Ausf being the adopted term for the ones desgigned purely for combat.
