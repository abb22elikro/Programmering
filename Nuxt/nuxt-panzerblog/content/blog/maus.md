The Maus or the Panzer VIII was meant to be the ultimate weapon of the German ground forces. With germany being big on the whole "Bigger gun = better" as exemplified by the Schwerer Gustav and Karl Ger√§t it didn't take long for them to try and engineer a more mobile version. This was the Maus. The tank was itself a beast, classified as a super-heavyweight, its the heaviest armored land vehicle ever, weighing in at 188 tons. For a reference the KV-2 at 45 tons is deemed a heavy tank and the T28 is deemed a super-heavy at around 86 tons. Only two chassi were ever finished and only one turret was actually made and mounted. Its armor was quite literally impenetrable at the time, the thinnest armor was located in the rear and was 15 cm thick. This monstrosity had a crew of six. Two of these being designated loaders for the 128 mm KwK gun. The main problem with the vehicle was its weight, there simply wern't any engines capable of driving this thing which ultimately led to it never being deployed on the frontlines.
