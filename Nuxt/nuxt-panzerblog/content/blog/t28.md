The T28 or also referred to as "The Elephant" was an American super-heavy tank weighing around 86 tons. But just as the Maus, this one didn't fair a lot better with only two units ultimately being built. Although its problems we're different than the Panzer VIII. The Maus's main problem was its weight that made it fail several trials. But while the T28 eventually passed most combat trials it was too late. By the time the first units were meant to be deployed in Germany, they had already surrendered. It was then decided for five T28 to be constructed to be deployed in Japan, but once again they surrendered before it could see any use. As for the tank itself it was quite the spectacle, it had very thick armor and one hell of a gun hoisting the 105mm T5E1. It had four tracks as opposed to two which greatly reduced its preassure and made it easier to navigate in unstable terrain. The outer tracks could also be removed on the field either for repairs or to operate in a narrower enviroment. One thing was certain though, this Maus-class tank was a real threat that you did not want to mess with.
