description: "The KV-2 known by its crew as The Dreadnought was deployed during the Winter War. Its  focus was extreme firepower and armor. However it lacked severely in mobility being outmanuvered by even medium weight German tanks. The tradeoff however was enough firepower to easily punch through bunkers as well as tank armor"

<h1 class="text-xl font-bold">The Dreadnought</h1>
The KV-2 was one of the Soviet Unions main battletanks. It was widely used during the winter war as Finnish anti-tank rounds and mines had little to no effect on its bulky chassi and thick hull. The other use was in defending Stalingrad during operation Barbarossa. The tank has a gun well capable of bunker-busting so it performed decently in combat. The main issue being how clunky it was to manouver and aim. You had to be rather careful as one wrong rotation could tip over the tank rendering it useless. Other than that the tank itself weighed around 45 tons making it a lot heavier than most other tanks at the time. The main issue being operating in uneven terrain which it already didn't exceed in but also crossing critical points such as bridges or rivers became a real struggle due to the support needed for it to make it across safely. The disadvantages ulitmately outweighed the advantages as the model was discontinued after the war. Although one should not underestimate how much of a Juggernaut this thing was, it could pierce most if not all armored oposition and it demanded a point-blank AP round to do real damage to it.
