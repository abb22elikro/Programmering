<h1 class="text-xl font-bold">The Backbone</h1>
The T-34 is the most produced tank EVER with 84 000 units being built. This was the main Soviet battletank and it has been for ages and it still remains in service to this date. It held a 75.2mm gun which was later upgraded to a 85mm gun with the T-34-85. While the tank itself isnt that impressive compared to what it faced, mainly the Tiger 1 and Panther. But the ease and cheapness of production meant that these things were pumped out on factory bands. Winning battle through sheer numbers was the main advantage of the vehichle. Supported by the insane threat from the KV-2. Much like the American Sherman M4, this was the backbone of the Red Armys tank-divisions neigh ground infantry in general. It had to be switched out during the later stages of the war as even with its 85mm gun it couldnt hold its own against the ever increasing numbers of German Panthers and Tiger 1. It was replaced by the IS-2 to deal with these particular targets but the vehichles are still operated and used today.
