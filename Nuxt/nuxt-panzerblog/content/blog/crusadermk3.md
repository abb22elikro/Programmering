The Crusader is a cruiser-class tank with a lot of changes during its lifespan. It started with the Mark I, a lightweight tank with lacking firepower meant to try and outmanouver the expanding frontlines of German Panzer III and Panzer IV. The Mark II was fitted with thicker armor and a larger caliber gun yet still didn't perform very well. The Mark III on the other hand was the British main tank during the North African campaign which can be seen clearly in its coating and camouflage. With its even larger gun, thicker armor and insane speeds of 42 km/h, it was one of the fastest medium-weight tanks at the time being able to go toe-to-toe with Germanys elite Panzer III and Panzer IV. Relying on its speed to outmanouver the oposition with encireclements and bombardments. The tradeoff was getting rid of the loader, demanding that the commander fill the role. Thus it became operational with a three-man crew since they skipped the anti-infantry gun as well. The Mk III was later replaced by the M3 Grant and M4 Sherman since it was too hard to try and fit upgraded armaments on the turret/chassi. But it was a real terror on the battlefield rapidly approaching the German forces from every angle possible.
