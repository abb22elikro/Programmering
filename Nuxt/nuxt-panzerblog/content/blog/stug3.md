description: "The Sturmgeschutz III often shorted as StuG 3 is an assault gun deployed by Germany during WW2. The design built on top of experience from WW1 where the artillery was not mobile enough to follow advancing infantry to neutralize bunkers and pillboxes. Thus the StuG became the solution for the coming war."

<h1 class="text-xl font-bold">The Artillery</h1>
The Sturmgeschutz series of German tanks took lessons in its design from the first world war. A common problem was that the heavier artillery was too slow and unable to keep up with ground troops to destroy key targets such as bunkers and pillboxes. This spawned the ever more populas Sturmgeschutz or "StuG's" during WW2 to be able to deal with such threats. And it performed well. The vehichle, although not great in tank warfare since it's also an assault gun, filled its role very well and was able to keep its spot in the Germany fronlines for almost the entire war. After certain improvements, mainly to the armament it was eventually employed as a tank destroyer, capable of dealing with a lot of the oposition from greater distances. It couls also mount a shielded 7.92mm machine gun to better help support infantry. All these factors lead to it being very popular and around 11 000 units were constructed.
