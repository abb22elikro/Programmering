<h1 class="text-xl font-bold">The Icon</h1>
The Tiger I is most likely the most famous and recogniseable tanks ever. It has appeared in both movies, comics and even if people don't know the name it is likely one of the images that pop up when someone mentions a tank. A large part of this is due to how easy it is to tell apart from other tanks. The frame of the tank does not contain any sloped armor like the Panzers before it had employed to deflect shells. This gives it that very square/box look. But just because it didn't have the sloped armor didn't mean it was an easy target. With its 88mm gun, the Tiger 1 was designed as a breacher tank meant to lead the German frontlines during Operation Barbarossa and it did so with great success. Being too much to handle for the Soviet KV-1 and T-34. The Tiger I was so succesful, upgrades started to roll out immidietly, skirts for the tracks, better rounds etc. And the Tiger II was put in production and deployed already year 1944. Another reason its so iconic today is due to its large number of appearances in media, it held the major role in Fury and also made several appearances during Kelly's Heroes. Overall this design struck gold, balancing heavy defenses with explosive power and decent speeds. The impact of the Tiger 1 should not be understated as it quite literally reformed the way the Allies had to approach tank warfare and created tanks such as the IS-2 which only had one purpose: To cage the Tiger.
