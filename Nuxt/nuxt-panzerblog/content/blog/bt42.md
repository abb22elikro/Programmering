<h1 class="text-xl font-bold">The Frankenstein</h1>
The BT-42 is classed as an assault gun due to it not having a 360 degree angle with its turret. It was deployed during the Continuation War and didn't see a lot of success. If we look closer on its components it should be obvious why. First of all, the chassi is taken from captured Soviet tanks of the BT-7 class. This model was later discontinued due to its lacking defensive capabilities. The gun is a 114mm Howitzer from the UK and it bears the fairly common American suspension system by the name Christie. The assault gun hoists a narrow frame and a wide turret making it a very easy target and not very fit to navigate rougher terrain. Even if the treads can be demounted and the vehicle can be driven on wheels it still is not very practical. With it having lacking armor and  unable to be used effectively on the frontlines its only real use with that much firepower would be flanking. And while its speed is fantastic, the high frame makes it easy to spot. So its not really a surprise only 18 were constructed. The only one remaning in operational condition stands at The Parola Armor museum in Finland. A relic of the past and the Frankenstein of the tank world.
